## Explanation of Flow:

| Step | Component                      | What Happens                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Browser**                    | User enters the URL and sends HTTPS request                                                    |
| 2  | **Azure DNS**                  | Resolves the domain to Azure Front Door’s IP                                                   |
| 3  | **Azure Front Door/CDN**       | Routes traffic to the nearest Azure region, applies WAF, and serves cached assets if available |
| 4  | **Static Web App/App Service** | Hosts and serves frontend files (HTML, JS, CSS)                                                |
| 5  | **Function App**               | Handles API logic, authentication, or backend rules                                            |
| 6  | **Database / Service Bus**     | Stores or transmits data between microservices                                                 |
| 7  | **Application Insights**       | Tracks latency, performance, and user metrics                                                  |
| 8  | **Browser**                    | Receives and renders the final UI                                                              |

### 1. DNS Resolution

When you hit Enter, the browser needs to figure out where to send your request.

- Your URL’s domain (myapp.azurewebsites.net or custom app.mydomain.com) is sent to a DNS resolver.

- The resolver queries DNS servers to find the IP address of the Azure Front Door or App Service endpoint.

- Azure uses Azure DNS or external DNS providers to resolve this.

- Once resolved, the IP is cached locally for faster future lookups.

> Key behind-the-scenes:
If you’ve mapped a custom domain, Azure Front Door or App Service automatically provisions SSL/TLS certificates (via DigiCert or Let’s Encrypt) to handle secure HTTPS traffic.

## 2. Network Routing via Azure Edge (Front Door / CDN)

Once your browser knows the IP, it makes an HTTPS request to that endpoint.

- The request typically first lands on Azure Front Door’s global edge network — Microsoft’s global CDN layer.

- This edge node:

      Handles TLS termination (decrypts HTTPS),
      
      Performs caching (if enabled),
      
      Applies WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules,

      Routes the request to the closest App Service or Static Web App origin region.

> Key insight:
Azure Front Door provides global load balancing, so your request might be served by the nearest edge POP (Point of Presence) — reducing latency.

## 3. Application Hosting Layer

Depending on how your UI is hosted, the next step differs slightly:

#### If using Azure Static Web Apps

- The request goes to an Azure Storage (Blob)-backed static content endpoint.

- Azure automatically serves your prebuilt index.html, CSS, JS, and asset files.

- Any route not found (e.g., /dashboard) is automatically rewritten to index.html (client-side routing support).

> Bonus:
If your app uses API routes (/api/...), they’re automatically proxied to an Azure Function running alongside your static content.


#### If using Azure App Service

The request hits a load balancer that routes traffic to one of your App Service instances (VMs).

Inside the instance:

- The IIS or Kestrel web server receives the request.

- The server serves your static assets or executes backend logic if needed.

- App Service runs in a sandboxed container on Azure’s shared or dedicated compute.

> Key insight:
App Service manages auto-scaling, health checks, and cold starts automatically behind the scenes.

---

## 4. Azure Networking Magic

Throughout this process:

- **Azure Traffic Manager** (optional) may direct traffic to different regions.

- **Azure CDN** might cache your static assets at the edge for better performance.

- **Azure Load Balancer** distributes incoming requests across instances.

- **Application Gateway** can add another layer for SSL termination, routing, or WAF.

## 5. Data & API Layer (if applicable)

If your UI makes API calls:

- Calls are routed (often via HTTPS) to Azure Functions, App Services, or AKS microservices.

- Azure Application Insights traces these requests and logs telemetry.

The APIs might interact with:

- Azure Cosmos DB / Azure SQL for data

- Azure Service Bus for messaging

- Azure Key Vault for secrets

## 6. Response Path

After the app or static content responds:

- The response goes back through:

      The App Service / Static Web App origin
      
      Azure Front Door or CDN
      
      The public Internet backbone
      
      To your browser

- The browser then renders HTML, executes JS, and loads styles.

## 7. Observability & Telemetry

All the while, Azure is collecting data:

- Application Insights logs request duration, exceptions, dependencies.

- Azure Monitor aggregates performance metrics.

- Front Door analytics records cache hits/misses and latency.

- You can view all of this in Azure Portal or Grafana dashboards.
