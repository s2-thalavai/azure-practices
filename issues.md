The error message 432 4.3.2 Concurrent connections limit exceeded indicates that your application or service attempted to open
too many simultaneous SMTP connections to the Microsoft 365 (Outlook) 
mail server, and the server rejected the request due to throttling limits.

## What this means

Microsoft Exchange Online enforces limits on the number of concurrent connections per user or service to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
When this threshold is exceeded, further connection attempts are temporarily blocked.

### Recommended Actions
Here’s how you can mitigate and resolve this issue:

### 1. Throttle your email sending logic
   
  Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.

  Limit the number of concurrent threads or tasks sending emails.
  
  Use a queue-based approach (e.g., Azure Queue + Azure Function) to serialize email dispatch.

### 2. Batch recipients

  Instead of sending individual emails to each recipient, consider batching multiple recipients into a single email using To, CC, or BCC.

### 3. Use connection pooling

  Reuse SMTP connections where possible instead of opening a new one for each email.

### 4. Monitor and log connection usage

  Track how many connections are opened per minute/hour.

  Use telemetry to identify spikes and adjust sending rate accordingly.

### 5. Review Microsoft’s guidance

  Visit Microsoft’s official documentation for detailed limits and best practices.

### 6. Consider using Microsoft Graph API
   
  If you're using SMTP directly, switching to Microsoft Graph API for sending emails can offer better scalability and built-in throttling management.

  Would you like help refactoring your Azure Function or email dispatch logic to be more compliant with these limits? 
  I can scaffold a modular retry-enabled email sender or queue-based dispatch strategy.
