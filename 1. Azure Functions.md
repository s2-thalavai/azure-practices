# Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-driven code without managing infrastructure. 
It's ideal for lightweight, modular tasks triggered by events like 

- HTTP requests,
- timers, or 
- cloud service changes.

It’s designed for 

- event-driven, 
- stateless, and
- short-lived tasks,

making it ideal for microservices, automation, and reactive workflows.

## What Is Azure Functions?

Azure Functions is part of **Microsoft Azure’s serverless offerings**. 
It allows developers to write small pieces of code ("functions") **that execute in response to events**. 
These functions **automatically scale** and only **consume resources while running**, making them cost-effective and efficient.

### Why Use Azure Functions?

- **No server management:** You don’t need to provision or maintain servers.

- **Event-driven execution:** Functions respond to triggers like HTTP requests, queue messages, or file uploads.

- **Cost efficiency:** You pay only for the time your code runs.

- **Rapid development:** Focus on business logic without worrying about infrastructure.

### Common Use Cases

- **API endpoints:** Lightweight HTTP-triggered functions for microservices or REST APIs.

- **Data processing:** **React to changes** in databases, blob storage, or queues.

- **Scheduled tasks:** Cron-like jobs for cleanup, reporting, or notifications.

- **IoT and telemetry:** Handle device messages or sensor data.

- **Workflow automation:** Trigger actions based on business events (e.g., invoice received → send email).

| **Category**       | **Example**                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API endpoints**   | Lightweight REST APIs, webhook handlers                       |
| **Data processing** | Blob ingestion, queue-based ETL, telemetry pipelines          |
| **Automation**      | Invoice validation, email dispatch, cleanup jobs              |
| **IoT**             | Sensor data ingestion, device event handling                  |
| **DevOps**          | CI/CD hooks, alerting, provisioning scripts                   |
| **AI orchestration**| Trigger RAG workflows, semantic extraction, validation        |

### Pros

- **Scalability:** Automatically scales based on demand.

- **Language flexibility:** Supports C#, JavaScript, Python, Java, PowerShell, and more.

-  **Integration:** Built-in bindings for Azure services like Cosmos DB, Event Grid, and Service Bus.

-  **Fast deployment:** Ideal for rapid prototyping and agile workflows.

-  **Durable Functions:** Enables stateful workflows with checkpoints.



### Cons

- **Cold start latency:** Latency on first invocation (esp. in Consumption plan).

- **Limited execution time:** Consumption plan functions have a timeout (default 5 minutes).

- **Complex debugging:** Distributed, event-driven architecture can complicate tracing.

- **Vendor lock-in:** Deep integration with Azure services may reduce portability.

- **Limited local state:** Stateless by design; use external storage for persistence.


## When to Use vs. Avoid

### Use Azure Functions when:

- You need lightweight, short-lived tasks.

- Your workload is event-driven and sporadic.

- You want to minimize infrastructure overhead.

### Avoid Azure Functions when:

- You need long-running processes or persistent state.

- You require fine-grained control over runtime and environment.

- Cold start latency is unacceptable for your use case.

## Strategic Fit for Your Architecture

- Given your expertise in modular document intelligence workflows, Azure Functions can be a powerful tool for:
 
- Semantic extraction triggers: Fire on blob upload or queue message.

- Contextual validation: Modular validators per vendor/invoice type.

- Audit-friendly dispatch: Email workflows with retry metadata and summary metrics.

- RAG orchestration: Trigger LangChain flows from Service Bus or Event Grid.

---

# Use Case: Invoice Validation with Audit Logging

- **Trigger:** Blob upload or Service Bus message Functionality:

- Parse invoice metadata (vendor, amount, date)

- Validate against business rules

- Log audit trail (status, timestamp, retry count)

- Emit result to downstream queue or storage

##

## Hello World

```

import { app } from '@azure/functions';

export async function helloHttp(request, context) {
    context.log('Processing request...');
    const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
  
    return {
      status: 200,
      body: `Hello, ${name || 'world'}!`
    };
  }
  
  app.http('helloHttp', {
    methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
    authLevel: 'anonymous',
    handler: helloHttp
  });
  
```

Then hit:

    http://localhost:7071/api/helloHttp?name=Siva

 
## Key Improvements:

- Structured Logging — context.log.error() makes it easier to spot errors in Application Insights.

- Axios-Specific Error Details — If you’re using axios, error.response?.data and error.response?.status help diagnose remote API failures.

- JSON Response — Azure Functions return objects automatically serialized, but specifying Content-Type ensures clarity.

- Avoid Leaking Sensitive Info — You only expose error.message, not full internals or tokens.
