# Azure Messaging vs Eventing

Azure offers four core messaging and event services—

- Service Bus, 
- Storage Queues, 
- Event Grid, and
- Event Hubs

—each tailored for different communication patterns like commands, telemetry, and reactive workflows.

## Azure Messaging vs Eventing: Key Concepts

- **Messages:** Carry intent—used for commands, requests, or actions expecting a response.

- **Events:** Represent facts—used to signal that something happened, without expecting a reply.

## Azure Messaging Services

| **Service**            | **Purpose**                                           | **Ideal For**                                             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Service Bus**    | Enterprise-grade messaging with queues and topics     | Order processing, decoupled microservices, retry logic     |
| **Azure Storage Queues** | Simple, cost-effective queueing                       | Lightweight background tasks, batch processing             |
| **Azure Relay**          | Direct communication between on-prem and cloud apps   | Hybrid scenarios, firewall-friendly messaging              |

## Azure Event Services

| **Service**           | **Purpose**                             | **Ideal For**                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Event Grid**   | Reactive event routing across services   | Blob uploads, resource changes, custom events          |
| **Azure Event Hubs**   | High-throughput event ingestion          | Telemetry, IoT, real-time analytics, Kafka-style streaming |

## When to Use What

| **Scenario**              | **Recommended Service** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Command-based messaging** | Service Bus              |
| **Simple queueing**         | Storage Queues           |
| **Event-driven workflows**  | Event Grid               |
| **Telemetry ingestion**     | Event Hubs               |
| **Hybrid connectivity**     | Azure Relay              |


## Pros

- **Scalable:** All services scale independently based on load.

- **Integrated:** Native bindings with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and more.

- **Secure:** Role-based access, encryption, and compliance-ready.

- **Flexible:** Choose based on latency, throughput, and delivery guarantees.

## Cons

- **Complexity: **Choosing the right service requires understanding patterns.

- **Cost variance:** Event Hubs and Service Bus can be pricier at scale.

- **Cold starts:** Serverless consumers may introduce latency.


## For your document intelligence workflows, you might use:

- Event Grid to trigger validation on blob upload.

- Service Bus to queue invoices for semantic extraction.

- Event Hubs to ingest telemetry from OCR or AI agents.
