# Azure Messaging vs Eventing

Azure offers four core messaging and event services—

- Service Bus, 
- Storage Queues, 
- Event Grid, and
- Event Hubs

—each tailored for different communication patterns like commands, telemetry, and reactive workflows.

## Azure Messaging vs Eventing: Key Concepts

- **Messages:** Carry intent—used for commands, requests, or actions expecting a response.

- **Events:** Represent facts—used to signal that something happened, without expecting a reply.

## Azure Messaging Services

| **Service**            | **Purpose**                                           | **Ideal For**                                             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Service Bus**    | Enterprise-grade messaging with queues and topics     | Order processing, decoupled microservices, retry logic     |
| **Azure Storage Queues** | Simple, cost-effective queueing                       | Lightweight background tasks, batch processing             |
| **Azure Relay**          | Direct communication between on-prem and cloud apps   | Hybrid scenarios, firewall-friendly messaging              |

## Azure Event Services

| **Service**           | **Purpose**                             | **Ideal For**                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Event Grid**   | Reactive event routing across services   | Blob uploads, resource changes, custom events          |
| **Azure Event Hubs**   | High-throughput event ingestion          | Telemetry, IoT, real-time analytics, Kafka-style streaming |

## When to Use What

| **Scenario**              | **Recommended Service** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Command-based messaging** | Service Bus              |
| **Simple queueing**         | Storage Queues           |
| **Event-driven workflows**  | Event Grid               |
| **Telemetry ingestion**     | Event Hubs               |
| **Hybrid connectivity**     | Azure Relay              |


## Pros

- **Scalable:** All services scale independently based on load.

- **Integrated:** Native bindings with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and more.

- **Secure:** Role-based access, encryption, and compliance-ready.

- **Flexible:** Choose based on latency, throughput, and delivery guarantees.

## Cons

- **Complexity: **Choosing the right service requires understanding patterns.

- **Cost variance:** Event Hubs and Service Bus can be pricier at scale.

- **Cold starts:** Serverless consumers may introduce latency.


## For your document intelligence workflows, you might use:

- Event Grid to trigger validation on blob upload.

- Service Bus to queue invoices for semantic extraction.

- Event Hubs to ingest telemetry from OCR or AI agents.

# Azure Messaging vs Event Services

Azure offers multiple messaging and eventing services tailored for different communication patterns. Here's a categorized comparison to guide architectural decisions.

---

## Messaging Services

| Service | Description | Use Cases |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Azure Service Bus** | Enterprise-grade messaging with queues and topics | Order processing, decoupled microservices, retry logic |
| **Azure Storage Queues** | Simple, cost-effective queueing | Background tasks, batch processing |
| **Azure Relay** | Direct hybrid messaging between cloud and on-prem | Firewall-friendly communication, hybrid apps |

---

## Event Services

| Service | Description | Use Cases |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Azure Event Grid** | Reactive event routing across services | Blob uploads, resource changes, custom events |
| **Azure Event Hubs** | High-throughput event ingestion | Telemetry, IoT, real-time analytics, Kafka-style streaming |

---

## Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Service Bus | Storage Queues | Event Grid | Event Hubs |
|---------|-------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Message intent** | Commands | Tasks | Facts | Telemetry |
| **Delivery guarantee** | At-least-once | At-least-once | Push-based | Partitioned stream |
| **Ordering** | FIFO (with sessions) | No guarantee | No guarantee | Per partition |
| **Throughput** | Moderate | Low | High | Very high |
| **Latency** | Low | Low | Very low | Low |
| **Protocol** | AMQP | REST | HTTP/Webhooks | Kafka/AMQP |
| **Integration** | Azure Functions, Logic Apps | Azure Functions | Functions, Logic Apps, Event Subscriptions | Stream Analytics, Functions, Kafka clients |

---

## Best Fit Scenarios

- **Service Bus**: Reliable messaging with retries and dead-lettering
- **Storage Queues**: Lightweight, cost-effective task queues
- **Event Grid**: Reactive workflows triggered by cloud events
- **Event Hubs**: Real-time ingestion of telemetry or logs

> Tip: Combine Event Grid + Service Bus for hybrid workflows—e.g., trigger invoice validation on blob upload, then queue for semantic extraction.
